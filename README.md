# Order-Management-System
# Description
This project is a simple TCP/IP client-server application written in Python that simulates an order management system. The server processes client requests, including placing, retrieving, and editing orders. It uses socket programming to establish reliable communication between the client and server, offering insights into network protocols and client-server architecture.

# Features
- Client-Server Communication: Uses Python sockets to send and receive messages.
- Order Management: Clients can place, retrieve, and edit orders via server requests.
- Networking Concept: Demonstrates TCP/IP communication between processes.

# Installation & Setup
1. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.
2. Clone the repository
3. Open a terminal and start the server
4. Open another terminal and run the client

# How It Works
1. The server listens for incoming connections.
2. The client connects to the server and sends requests to manage orders.
3. The server processes requests and sends responses back to the client.
